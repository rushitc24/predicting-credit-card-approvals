predicting credit card approvals
 
Project Summary: 

Lots of people are now applying for credit card. Many of them got reject for many different results. Manual analysis of those application take lot of time and delays and also error prone. Luckily Machine Learning Technique helps to automate this process. 

Source of Data: 
Credit Card Approval Data set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Life Cycle of Project: 
1.	Load and view the data set
2.	Divide numeric, categorical and their ranges also find out the missing values
3.	Ensure smooth machine learning process we must need to pre-process the data
4.	Exploratory data analysis is must before build our intuitions. 
5.	Build the machine learning model using logistic regression and used classification evaluating performance and applied grid searching technique for model performance and make a prediction.
